# Real-Time Age and Gender Prediction Tutorial

## Tutorial Overview

This tutorial guides you through creating an age and gender prediction application using OpenCV. It covers loading pre-trained models, face detection, and real-time age and gender prediction from video or images. 

## Installation

You'll need a working installation of Python to run the code examples and scripts. The code in this tutorial is written in Python 3.11.4.
Install required libraries using pip:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Download the [age_net.caffemodel](https://www.dropbox.com/s/xfb20y596869vbb/age_net.caffemodel?dl=0) and [gender_net.caffemodel](https://www.dropbox.com/s/iyv483wz7ztr9gh/gender_net.caffemodel?dl=0) and make sure they has the same directory as your project.

## Execution

After installing the necessary libraries and downloading the models, you can run 'age-and-gender-prediction-tutorial.py' to display real-time age and gender predictions.
